## GPU Compute Capability
The GPU version of `Prismatic` requires a CUDA-enabled GPU with compute capability >= 3.0.


<a name="dependencies"></a>
## Dependencies
The following dependencies are needed by `Prismatic`:

*Required*

* [CMake](https://CMake.org/) (*For compiling the source code*)  
* [Boost](http://www.boost.org)  
* [FFTW](http://www.fftw.org) (compiled with `--enable-float`, `--enable-shared`, and `--enable-threads`)  
* [HDF5](https://www.hdfgroup.org/solutions/hdf5/) (compiled with `--enable-threadsafe`,`--enable-cxx`, and `--enable-unsupported` )

*Optional*

* [CUDA Toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit) (*For GPU support*)  
* Python 3, a good choice is [the Anaconda distribution](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) (*For the python package*, `PyPrismatic`)  
* [Qt 5](https://www.qt.io/) (*For building the GUI*)  
* [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/) *For non-Windows systems, you must check the compatibility between your CUDA toolkit version, GCC version, and operating system. Check compatibilities within the [CUDA toolkit online documentations](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit-archive) under installation guides.* `Prismatic v1.2` was developed using CUDA 10.1, but likely works with older versions as well and we welcome feedback from any user who attempts to do so.
  *Note: Even if you download a binary version of the GPU codes, you will still need to have the CUDA toolkit installed so that the `cuFFT` libraries can be found at runtime.*

## Building `Prismatic` from the source code


`Prismatic` is built using [`CMake`](https://`CMake`.org/), a cross-platform compilation utility that 
allows a single source tree to be compiled into a variety of formats including UNIX Makefiles, 
Microsoft Visual Studio projects, Mac OS XCode projects, etc.


<a name="get-source-code"></a>
### Getting the source code 

Once the [dependencies](#dependencies) are installed get the `Prismatic` source either from [compressed source files](http://prism-em.com/installers/) or directly 
from [Github](https://github.com/prism-em/prismatic) using `git clone`. Next, follow the instructions appropriate for your operating system.

<a name="environmental-setup"></a>
## Environmental setup

`CMake` and/or `setuptools` needs to know where to find the [dependencies](#dependencies) in order to build `Prismatic` and `PyPrismatic`, respectively. In my opinion the easiest way to do this is by setting environmental variables. You can also manually provide paths to compilation commands, but if you take the time to setup your environment then everything should be automatically found. Follow the appropriate instructions below for your operating system.

<a name="environmental-setup-linux"></a>

#### Linux

These are the relevant environmental variables on Linux

* `CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH` - default search location for C++ header files  
* `LIBRARY_PATH` - default search location for C/C++ libraries  
* `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` - default search location for shared libraries to be loaded at runtime 

These variables can be set from the terminal with the `export` command. For example, to prepend an example header search path for boost "/usr/local/boost_1_60_0", header search for CUDA located at "/usr/local/cuda-8.0/include", and CUDA library path at "/usr/local/cuda-8.0/lib64" one could invoke

~~~
export CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH=/usr/local/boost_1_60_0:/usr/local/cuda-8.0/include:$CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH
export LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda-8.0/lib64:$LIBRARY_PATH
~~~

You can make these changes persistent by adding the same lines to your `~/.bashrc` file so that they are executed at startup every time you open a terminal. 

Depending how your system is configured and what portions of `Prismatic` you are building you may need to add additional paths. For example, if you are building the GUI, you will also need to provide the paths to Qt5 headers and libraries. See the [dependencies](#dependencies) for details about what is required. For linking HDF5, it may help CMake to provide the path to the root HDF5 install directory `HDF5_ROOT` and to directly link the individual libraries `HDF5_HL_LIBRARY`,`HDF5_LIBRARY`,`HDF5_HL_CPP_LIBRARY`, and `HDF5_CPP_LIBRARY` .

<a name="environmental-setup-mac"></a>

#### Mac OS X

These are the relevant environmental variables on Mac OS X

* `CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH` - default search location for C++ header files  
* `LIBRARY_PATH` - default search location for C/C++ libraries  
* `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` - default search location for shared libraries to be loaded at runtime 

These variables can be set from the terminal with the `export` command. For example, to prepend an example header search path for boost "/usr/local/boost_1_60_0", header search for CUDA located at "/usr/local/cuda-8.0/include", and CUDA library path at "/usr/local/cuda-8.0/lib64" one could invoke

~~~
export CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH=/usr/local/boost_1_60_0:/usr/local/cuda-8.0/include:$CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH
export LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda-8.0/lib64:$LIBRARY_PATH
~~~

You can make these changes persistent by adding the same lines to your `~/.bash_profile` file so that they are executed at startup every time you open a terminal. 

Depending how your system is configured and what portions of `Prismatic` you are building you may need to add additional paths. For example, if you are building the GUI, you will also need to provide the paths to Qt5 headers and libraries. See the [dependencies](#dependencies) for details about what is required. For linking HDF5, it may help CMake to provide the path to the root HDF5 install directory `HDF5_ROOT` and to directly link the individual libraries `HDF5_HL_LIBRARY`,`HDF5_LIBRARY`,`HDF5_HL_CPP_LIBRARY`, and `HDF5_CPP_LIBRARY` .

<a name="environmental-setup-win"></a>

#### Windows

These are the relevant environmental variables on Windows

* `PATH` - default search location for executables (.exe.) and shared libraries (.dll)
* `INCLUDE` - default search location for C++ headers  
* `LIB` - default search location for C++ libraries

These environmental variables can be set graphically through system settings. The specific details of how to this will vary depending on which version of Windows you are using, but a quick Google search should be able to provide you step-by-step instructions. For example, on Windows 10, typing "variable" into the search feature on the taskbar reveals "Edit the system environmental variables". 

Depending how your system is configured and what portions of `Prismatic` you are building you may need to add additional paths. For example, if you are building the GUI, you will also need to provide the paths to Qt5 headers and libraries. See the [dependencies](#dependencies) for details about what is required. For linking HDF5, it may help CMake to provide the path to the root HDF5 install directory `HDF5_ROOT` and to directly link the individual libraries `HDF5_HL_LIBRARY`,`HDF5_LIBRARY`,`HDF5_HL_CPP_LIBRARY`, and `HDF5_CPP_LIBRARY` . If using the graphical CMake interface, the configure process will automatically raise flags for any dependency not found with the environment variables. and you will be able to add them through the file browser.

## Installing on Linux  

<a name="compiling-linux"></a>
### Compiling with `CMake` from the command line on Ubuntu Linux

To build `Prismatic` from the command line with `CMake`, open a terminal and navigate to the top of the source directory 

```
cd /path/to/prismatic/
```

Conventional `CMake` practice is to use out-of-source builds, which means we will compile the source code into
a separate directory. This has a number of advantages including providing the flexibility to build multiple
version of `Prismatic` (such as compiling with/without GPU support), and allowing for easier cleanup. First, 
make a build directory (the name doesn't matter) at the top of the `Prismatic` source tree.

```
mkdir build
cd build
```
Then invoke `cmake`

```
cmake ../
```

This will generate a Makefile  project with the necessary dependencies and paths to compile `Prismatic`. The default
behavior is to build only the CLI without GPU support. These options can be enabled as described in later sections.
Finally, compile and install `Prismatic` with:

```
make
```

For faster compilation, add the `-j` switch to `make` to use multiple threads, for example to compile with 8 threads

```
make -j 8
```

If this succeeds, the executable file `Prismatic` has been built and can be run from within the build directory. To permanently 
install them, invoke

``` 
make install
```

which may require `sudo` privileges. This will place the files in `/usr/local/bin`. 

`CMake` will attempt to locate the various dependencies needed by `Prismatic` (see the section on [setting up your environment](#environmental-setup)), but if it cannot then it will produce an error and set the variable to NOTFOUND. For example, if the `Boost_INCLUDE_DIR` (the location of the Boost libraries), is not found, it will be set to `Boost_INCLUDE_DIR-NOTFOUND`. You will need to manually set the path to boost (see [below](#cmake-options) for how to set options), and then rerun `CMake`.

### Compiling with `CMake` from the command line on OS X

*If you prefer a graphical approach, you can use the ``CMake`-gui` and follow analagous steps as [in Windows](#compiling-win)*

To build `Prismatic` from the command line with `CMake`, open a terminal and navigate to the top of the source directory 

```
cd /path/to/prismatic/
```

### Compiling with `CMake`'s GUI on Windows

To build `Prismatic` on Windows with the `CMake` GUI, first open `CMake` and set the location of the source code to the top level directory of `Prismatic` (this is the directory  containing "CMakeLists.txt"). Next, choose the location to build the binaries. It is recommended to create a separate folder, perhaps called "build", for this purpose. Click `Configure`, and choose the C++ compiler you would like to use. `Prismatic v1.2` was successfully built with Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 (64-bit) and CUDA 10.1, though older versions may be more stable depending on your particular CUDA toolkit if you are compiling with GPU-support due to the fact that both NVIDIA and Microsoft are proprietary vendors, there is often some conflict between the newest versions of `nvcc` and MSVS. 

Based on the [option settings](cmake-options), `CMake` will then attempt to find the necessary dependencies. If you [have fully setup your environment](#environmental-setup-win), then configuration should succeed. If it fails, then variables it cannot satisfy will be set to NOTFOUND. For example, if the `Boost_INCLUDE_DIR` (the location of the Boost libraries), is not found, it will be set to `Boost_INCLUDE_DIR-NOTFOUND`. You will need to manually set the path to boost (see [below](#cmake-options) for how to set options), and then rerun `Configure`. Sometimes it is not necessary to specify a value for every "NOTFOUND" variable if there are multiple ones from the same dependency as CMake may be able to find them relative to one of the variables you do specify. For example, if you specify the path to one of the Qt libraries and reconfigure the other ones will likely be found automatically. Other `CMake` variables, like `FFTW_MPI_LIBRARY`, are not used by `Prismatic` and if they can be left "NOTFOUND". In my opinion the easiest thing to do is to specify the value of whatever variables are causing error messages one-by-one until configuration succeeds.

Once configuration is complete, click `Generate` and a MSVS .sln file will be created. Open this file, set the build mode to "Release" (*make sure you done forget this! If the build mode is not Release when you build `cuPrismatic.dll` then bad things will happen later down the road*), and then run "Build Solution" to compile the code. You may find that the build process randomly fails and then works after trying a second (or third, or fourth) time. This is often due to project access issues since multiple projects often access the same object files. Turning off parallel project building in Visual Studio can make the build process more consistently stable. You can then find the executable `prismatic-gui.exe` inside of the "Release" folder within the build directory you selected in the `CMake` GUI. The `Install` project is not automatically built, but if done, it will automatically install `Prismatic` into your Program Files.

## Python: Installing `PyPrismatic`
`PyPrismatic` is a Python package for invoking the C++/CUDA code in `Prismatic`. It can be installed easily with `pip` provided the following dependencies are installed:  

*Required*

* [Boost](http://www.boost.org/)  
* [FFTW](http://www.fftw.org) (compiled with `--enable-float`, `--enable-shared`, and `--enable-threads`)    

*Optional*
* [The CUDA Toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads) (*For GPU support*)    
* [The `cuPrismatic` library](#`cuPrismatic`) (*For GPU support*)  

If your C compiler is `gcc`, you **MUST** have version 4.7-4.9 installed (gcc-5 or greater will cause crashes because the CUDA code is compiled with gcc-4).  

*The optional dependencies are only necessary if you wish to use the GPU code. You will also need an NVIDIA GPU with compute capability 3.0 or greater and will add the `--enable-gpu` to the installation command. More details can be found below.*




<a name="installing-with-pip-cuda"></a>
### Installing `PyPrismatic` with Pip


If you have installed the above dependencies and [setup your environmental variables](#environmental-setup), `PyPrismatic` can be installed easily with `pip` using either 

~~~
pip install pyprismatic
~~~

for CPU-only mode or for GPU mode:

~~~
pip install pyprismatic --install-option="--enable-gpu"
~~~


Alternatively, you can tell `pip` where the dependencies are using `--global-option` like so (*you should change the actual names of the paths to match your machine, this is just an example*):

~~~
pip install pyprismatic --global-option=build_ext --global-option="-I/usr/local/boost_1_60_0"
~~~

for CPU-only mode or for GPU mode:

~~~
pip install pyprismatic --global-option=build_ext --global-option="-I/usr/local/boost_1_60_0:/usr/local/cuda-8.0/include" --global-option="-L/usr/local/cuda-8.0/lib64" --install-option="--enable-gpu"
~~~

*On Windows, a list containing multiple path names must be separated by `;` instead of `:`*

<a name="installing-with-setup"></a>

### Installing with setup.py

To install the python package from the source code with `setup.py`, first [get the source code](#get-source-code). Then navigate to the top directory (the one with `setup.py`) and invoke 

~~~
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
~~~

To install the Python dependencies. Next enter either (*you should change the actual names of the paths to match your machine, this is just an example*)

~~~
python3 setup.py build_ext --include-dirs=/usr/local/boost_1_60_0 install
~~~

to compile in CPU-only mode, or the following to compile the GPU version

~~~
python3 setup.py build_ext --include-dirs=/usr/local/boost_1_60_0:/usr/local/cuda-8.0/include --library-dirs=/usr/local/cuda-8.0/lib64 install --enable-gpu
~~~

*On Windows, a list containing multiple path names must be separated by `;` instead of `:`*


If you have [setup your environmental variables](#environmental-setup), you can ignore the extra arguments and just use `python3 setup.py install` or `python3 setup.py install --enable-gpu` 


<a name="cuprismatic"></a>

### Building the `cuPrismatic` library

*This step is only required for GPU support in `PyPrismatic`*

One of the great features about `CMake` is that it can easily tolerate the complicated task of compiling a single program with multiple compilers, which is necessary when mixing CUDA and Qt (discussed more [here](http://prism-em.com/source-code/#combining)).  For a CPU-only version of `PyPrismatic`, the necessary C++ source code can be distributed with the Python package, and `setuptools` can easily compile the necessary C++ extension module. Unfortunately, to my knowledge `setuptools` does not play nicely with `nvcc`, which makes distributing a Python package that utilizes custom GPU code more challenging. My solution was to compile the CUDA code into a a single shared library called `cuPrismatic`, which can then be linked against in the Python package as if it were any other C++ library. There is no "new" code in `cuPrismatic`, it simply serves as an intermediate step to help Python out by bundling the GPU code together into something it can work with. As an aside, this type of step is all `CMake` is doing under-the-hood to make CUDA and Qt play nicely in the first place -- it's just compiling the various formats of source code into a commonly understood form.

With that being said, in order to install the GPU-enabled version of `PyPrismatic`, you must first build `cuPrismatic`. To do so, you will need to [get the source code](#get-source-code), set the `PRISMATIC_ENABLE_PYTHON_GPU=1` variable in `CMake`, then configure and compile the project. More detail on this process of using `CMake` is [described above](#from-source). Once the library is installed, then proceed below.

<a name="testing-`PyPrismatic`"></a>
### Testing `PyPrismatic`

You can test your installation of `PyPrismatic` with the following commands from within `python3`

~~~ python
import pyprismatic as pr
pr.demo()
~~~

*Note: If you receive an error like `ImportError: cannot import name core` but the installation process appeared to work, make sure to change directories out of the top level of the source code and try again. This occurs because the `PyPrismatic` package was built and installed globally, but if you are currently in the top level directory that contains the source code folder `PyPrismatic` then python will attempt to use that incorrectly as the package.*

<a name ="setting-cmake-options"></a>
## Setting `CMake` options

All aspects of how `Prismatic` is compiled, such as whether or not to include GUI or GPU support, are controlled through `CMake` variables.
There are at least four different ways to adjust these:

If you are using the `CMake` GUI, then options are turned on/off with check boxes
and paths are set by clicking browse and navigating to the file/folder of interest.   

If you are using the command line tool, `CMake`, then options are set with the `-D` (Define) flag. For example, 
to set `MY_VARIABLE` to 0 one would add `-DMY_VARIABLE=0` to the call to `CMake` (see the sections on enabling GUI or GPU support for more examples).

There is also the hybrid "command-line GUI" option, `ccmake`, which provides an interactive way to adjust `CMake` options from the command line.

Finally, you can also directly edit a file called "CMakeCache.txt". The first time you run `CMake` for a given project
this special file will be created containing all of the option settings. Whenever you generate a project or Makefile, the options
will be read for the "CMakeCache.txt" file, so options can be changed here directly.


**_Note_**: Any time you change `CMake` options for a particular project you must regenerate the build files and recompile
before the changes will actually take effect

### Enabling Double Precision

*Currently, this double precision setting is not supported by `PyPrismatic`*

The default behavior for `Prismatic` is to use single precision (type float). You can use double precision instead by setting `PRISMATIC_ENABLE_DOUBLE_PRECISION=1`. Note that as of this writing double precision operations are ~4x slower on the GPU, and by every test I have done the precision difference is entirely unnoticeable. However, I leave it as an option. If you find a case where using double precision is impactful, I would be very interested to hear about it.


<a name ="cmake-options"></a>
## List of `Prismatic` `CMake` options

Here's a list of the various custom options you can set and `CMake` and what they represent

* `PRISMATIC_ENABLE_CLI` - Build the command line interface `prismatic`"
* `PRISMATIC_ENABLE_GPU` - Enable GPU supprt. Requires locating CUDA headers/libraries
* `PRISMATIC_ENABLE_GUI` - Build the GUI, `prismatic-gui`. Requires locating Qt5 headers/libraries. A good way to do this is by setting `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` to point to the root of your Qt installation. For example, with Qt5 installed on a Mac through Homebrew one might add `-DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/usr/local/Cellar/qt/5.9.0/` to the call to `cmake`
* `PRISMATIC_ENABLE_PYTHON_GPU` - Build the `cuPrismatic` shared library, which is used by the GPU version
* `PRISMATIC_ENABLE_DOUBLE_PRECISION` - Use type `double` for float precision. This requires locating the double precision `FFTW` libraries.
